# Project Heading:
### Litycia-XO game

#### Project description
>Web Framework: Replit to code
Short Brief:
++ is used to develop a famous game that used to be played with a pen and a paper, or on paint (a function in the computer). This games are played by two players, one of them needs to be playing with the letter “X” and the other with the letter “O”. The game is played on a grid which is constituted as 3 squares by 3 squares.  The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row in different geometrical ways such as: (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie. 


### Features
>  using the do loop to execute 
>  using trueorfalse loop
>  "char" is an integral data type, that stores values as an integer.
>  setting up a grill
>  using the else and if : 


### Reflective analysis:
This project was a my very first project in my first year, it was fun using C++ functionalities in a game , In this project I learned many things about loops,if and else conditions,while, else if , char, int;
